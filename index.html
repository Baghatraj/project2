          Australia outlasted another epic solo assault by England captain Ben Stokes to win the second Ashes test by 43 runs with a session to spare on a salty last day on July 2. Stokes seemed to be pulling a stunning victory out of impending defeat for England with an astonishing 155 that echoed another unforgettable century in a thrilling fourth-innings chase to win the Ashes test at Headingley in 2019.

          Again, he turned hope into expectation for a sold-out crowd and helped to reduce a never-reached 371 target at Lord&#39;s to 70.Then he  was gone, top-edging a short ball from Josh Hazlewood behind to wicketkeeper Alex Carey. A febrile Lord’s sunk into silence until the crowd rose to send Stokes off to a sustained standing ovation. He was the seventh man out, and the tail wagged for another hour. But failed to achieve the win.

          England was all out for 327 and congratulated Australia on the pavilion steps after the victors were booed off the field. Australia leads the series 2-0 and the holder can clinch a first Ashes series win in England since 2001 at Headingley in the third test starting on Thursday. England’s chances of retaking the urn were bleak. Only one team has ever come back from 2-0 down in the Ashes, and it had Don Bradman, in 1937.

          The match wasn’t as epic as last week’s opening test at Edgbaston, which was a thriller for all five days, but the last day at Lord’s will live long in Ashes infamy as Stokes embellished his legend and the Australians were booed mercilessly and accused in crowd chants of cheating. But we can hope that England can comeback and try to win the test match to avoid losing the ashes series. See you guys at the next match.
